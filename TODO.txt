TODO:

Code cleaning/optimisation:

Functionalities / Improvements:
- Add buttons for solving by steps and in one go
- Add option for entering clues
    *One way would be to add popups with an Enter widget, where tab/enter both validates and goes to the next clue.
- Add option to save clues to json
- Add option to create nonogram from an image

Aesthetics / QoL:
- When a match happens, add an animation

Bugfix:
